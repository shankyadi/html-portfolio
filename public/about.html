<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Aditya Shankar, and I recently embarked on my journey into web development. I've completed a few projects under the guidance of Angela from AppBrewery, and I'm enthusiastic about learning more every day. Currently, I'm in the learning phase, diligently working to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of web development. As I progress, I plan to upload more of my projects to showcase my growth and commitment to this field.</p>

  <p>I'm a student at Manipal University Jaipur, located in Rajasthan, India, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech). This academic environment provides me with a solid foundation in engineering principles, which complements my web development endeavors. I am passionate about blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications, and web development offers the perfect platform to do just that.</p>
  
  <p>My goal is to continuously improve, stay updated with the latest trends and technologies, and eventually make meaningful contributions to the web development community. I believe in the power of hard work and perseverance, and I'm committed to keeping track of my progress and development. By sharing my journey, I hope to inspire others and connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology and innovation.</p>
